she 's coming with us .
you 're not my friend , otherwise you 'd understand me .
she does what she can to help .
tom was going to kill them .
i thought you and tom were married to each other .
maybe we won 't find anyone to do that .
it 's not necessary , is it ?
if i 'd only read the contract more carefully !
who 's supposed to help you ?
i 'm worried about what other people might think .
tom is good at french , but mary isn 't .
that made me feel very uncomfortable .
tom hasn 't been told he shouldn 't do that yet .
come on let 's catch that guy .

mary is right where she belongs .
tom is pretty conservative , isn 't he ?
tom asked me to close the gate .
i plan to be here until about 2 : 30 .
what 's your average day like ?
that 's an entirely different matter .
sami had a lot of keys .
i really , truly believe that .
have pity on me !
i am taking a holiday at the beach .
were tom and mary working alone ?
the library was empty .
i wish i could do that as well as you can .
he has brought nothing but trouble here !
just leave everything to me .
why didn 't someone tell me ?
that 's a nice suit .
i have lots of other things i want to do .
that doesn 't leave us much time .
i 'm always under pressure .
he not only made the plan of a new house but built it himself .
i didn 't have to go to australia last week .

the sun came out .
i could say a lot about this topic .
is tom asking too much ?
sami and layla began having an affair .
he said he 'd been ill .
mary said she didn 't see tom .
how come you never told that me you were from australia ?
i thought tom and mary weren 't finished doing that .
what did dad do ?

tom will probably do that tomorrow , too .
i have a good english dictionary .
tom said that mary couldn 't speak french very well .
i thought that you said that you wanted me to buy that for you .
i wonder whether tom is finished or not .
please tell us more about yourselves .
tom didn 't tell me this .
it doesn 't have to end like that .
i know what you thought .
maria asked me to help her in mathematics .
i wonder if tom and mary are still interested in doing that .
what are you doing here in australia ?
i told you i 'm not busy .
i hired him .

they let her marry him .
tom tried a different approach .
i haven 't paid tom yet .
sami called the school security .
tom has finally done something right .
this is no time to argue .
sami was trying to ruin layla 's wedding party .
i hit upon a good idea .
i will deal with her myself .
sami 's mouth was <unk> and he couldn 't talk .
tom said he thought that mary might want to do that by herself .
he didn 't like her at first .
you may find it a bit <unk> if you can 't use the internet .
they told me they were feeling bad .
it is <unk> to have a try at it .
he may be in over his head .
they told me that they couldn 't do that .
i 'm not capable of <unk> this work alone .
i wasn 't the only one who needed to do that .
tom went for three weeks without <unk> before his wife complained .
i know that i 'm in big trouble now .
tom said he did his homework by himself .
it is quite natural for her to be angry with you .
although the <unk> " world peace " sounds attractive , the road to world peace is very long and full of <unk> .
i will write to her tomorrow .
getting there wasn 't easy .
sami and layla never went anywhere .
he is not so foolish but he can tell that .
is tom good at speaking french ?
sami parked his car in layla 's apartment complex .

what could 've happened to him ?
she can be mean sometimes .
mary is going to be very sorry if she doesn 't do that .
the operation is <unk> by a lot of pain .
i didn 't have a pencil .
i admit that i didn 't do what tom told me i was supposed to do .
he cut himself free with his knife .
sami can 't bring his blanket to the dinner table .
if i were you , i 'd buy that one .
tom and mary say that they don 't want to do that .
tom and mary are bothering me .
what are these things used for ?
this makes me sad .
his voice is pleasant to listen to .
sami had space .
tom asked me what i wanted .
tom expects to go home in a few weeks .
the boy told me why he was crying .
don 't forget that we have homework .
rainy season has begun .
hold on for your lives .
i want to live a <unk> life in the country .
you don 't feel like doing that , do you ?
that 's something tom used to do .
she says she won 't do that .
tom told me that he thought mary was out .
his wife left him and he was fired from his job .
you 're drunk !
he wore a hat , which meant that he wasn 't being followed and it was safe to <unk> .
i think i 'll go home early today and do some cooking .
mary said she wouldn 't do what i asked her to do .
i 'm just joking .
tom and mary know more than they 're <unk> on .
the sign <unk> you that the police will <unk> your car away if you park here .
we want to be very careful with tom .
it is certain that he didn 't go out that day .
with respect to that , i agree with you .

tom was obviously not having a good time .
tom and mary have a big house .
did you hug you children yesterday ?
as the saying goes , " nothing <unk> , nothing gained . "
she said that she thinks she can win .
it never actually happened .
what is wrong with that guy ?
tom <unk> out of the bar with a bottle in his hand .
that 's why we 're sitting here .

the city can be reached in less than 20 minutes by car from here .
i have a <unk> for tom 's arrest .
i 'm supposed to do that on monday .
i got tired doing that .

mary bought eggs , but she forgot to buy bread .
mary has a red <unk> in her hair .
that 's what people don 't understand .

i told tom to go see a doctor .
two boys are absent from school today .
his eyes are like those of a <unk> .
tom is <unk> hard so that someday he 'll be able to play the <unk> as well as mary does .
i don 't think that tom knows how much coffee mary drinks every day .
you wouldn 't be any happier if i told you .
at best he may take third place .
the problem is that tom doesn 't want to sit next to mary .
jack is a powerful <unk> for our team .

i don 't want to be here any more than you do .
the small house had come to look <unk> , though it was just as good as ever <unk> .

tom is your uncle , isn 't he ?
there must be another way .

here , you have translated from the sentence in <unk> the language you have translated from <unk> and you created a link to that one . i think this is the sentence in <unk> the language you want to translate from <unk> that you wanted to translate . to do this , you must first <unk> on the sentence in <unk> the language you want to translate from <unk> before <unk> on the translation button . the sentence that you are <unk> must always stand on top of the <unk> ( in the largest <unk> ) and it is the only one <unk> at the time you 're <unk> your translation , and that is on purpose to avoid influence on your translation , as in tatoeba , sentences are <unk> by <unk> , not as <unk> , since a sentence may have several different <unk> in the same language !
sami wanted layla out of the picture .

i didn 't give anything to her .
