i 'm happy about talking to you .
for the first twenty years of her life , she was often mistaken for a boy .
mary tried to tell tom what she was planning to do .
it was an awful movie .
what 's wrong with going to boston by myself ?
so , what do we need to do ?
why don 't tom and i do that right now ?
a little lower .
i recommend that you don 't go there by yourself .
i turned off the engine .
tom probably knows a lot more than he told us .
let 's ask tom what he thinks .
didn 't you know tom saw you doing that ?
am i allowed to use your car today ?
i was surprised when tom told me that he 'd spent three years in prison .
i 'm glad you were able to go to boston with tom .
may i use your pencil ?
how much for the night ?
tom said that it was all perfectly normal , but it isn 't .
i just remembered something .
i was afraid i might lose my job .
it 's better to take one 's time than to hurry and make mistakes .
sami was still sitting there .
things seem better now .
why do you care about them ?
i thought that you and i could do that together .
mary told tom that she didn 't think john was afraid .
i never said i was an expert .
i always work while listening to the radio .
he went on a fishing trip .
did you think i wouldn 't notice ?
it isn 't supposed to rain today .

who do they think it is ?
let me see what else my <unk> wants .

would you mind giving us a minute ?
sami and layla had a very <unk> relationship .
add a bit of sugar , please .
she looked like she was upset .
i ask you for nothing .
are you two ready to go ?
why didn 't you tell tom that he didn 't need to do that ?
try this one .
you 'd tell me if there was a problem , right ?
tom and mary told me that they were lazy .
i suspect that tom and mary have never done that together .

i used that blue piece of <unk> you gave me to make a shirt for tom .
saturday is when i am least busy .

i knew all that .
sleeping seems like a lot of work because it 's not so easy to do anymore .
tom was convinced mary no longer needed to do that .
he has a brother who lives in tokyo .
i wanted to be with her all the time .
our world keeps getting smaller .
tom tried to keep his explanation simple .
this is not my ticket .
i know that tom isn 't a very smart guy .
i fell to the ground .
that isn 't the main reason that tom ought to do that .
tom and mary looked at each other and <unk> .
i 'm not on drugs .
i think tom is still sick .

how many people will be living on earth in one century ?
she went into her room to dress herself .
i own a yellow sports car .
she took her children to the park .
layla was the perfect wife .
i know the reason why tom and mary haven 't done that .
i need to get outside .
those are all the questions i 'm going to answer right now .
i wouldn 't have been able to do that if you hadn 't helped .
the government has lost <unk> with the public .
they said that they liked speaking french .
<unk> might well burst into tears to meet his mother again .
they say that they 're canadians .
<unk> made it difficult for me to find a job .
yes , it 's time to go .
we judge people every day .
mary did everything she thought tom would want her to do .
the bus left the stop .
you never do that by yourself , do you ?
she didn 't want me to sit by her .
just stay where you are .
it was tough , but worth every drop of sweat .
she is at the office .
i see something moving .
my brother is evil .
tom seemed really laid back and happy .
mary has finished eating her lunch .
there 's something tom didn 't tell mary .
he plays baseball tomorrow .
at the edge of the road laid a dead <unk> .
tom had no income then .
tom is almost always right , isn 't he ?
the bridge will be <unk> by the end of this year .
i need to find out what has to be done .
how did you know that i wasn 't the one who did that ?
i know tom doesn 't have the courage to do that .
tom will tell mary .
she looked like she was surprised .
i didn 't think that you could help us .
tom said that he didn 't think that mary needed to do that .
i just did what i always do .
he cut a poor figure after his long illness .
tom had a chance to do that , but he decided not to .
promise you won 't tell him .
it isn 't easy to sit around and watch .
we will be back at half past three .
tom never said he wanted to go with us .
where does this street lead to ?
mary knew she wouldn 't be allowed to do that .
do you remember the first time you talked to tom ?
what an incredible show !
i 'll see you in a couple days .
we caught sight of his boat .
tom called his mother to wish her a happy mother 's day .

i liked those women .
all traffic was brought to a <unk> because of the accident .
tom really thought we didn 't have to do that .
our friendship remained firm .
sami never had anybody over .
everyone else hates us .
i want to know about everything you 've done .
i 'm really surprised that tom isn 't here .
tom said that he 'd been offered three thousand dollars .
why would you ever think so ?
friends and relatives are invited .
thanks very much for having me to dinner the other night .
tom said mary thought he might not have to do that today .
i don 't think that tom knows what time the meeting will start .
would you care to leave a message ?
tom and mary say that they 'll come right away .
tom slept on the porch last night because he 'd locked himself out of his house .
mary said that she thought tom was getting hungry .
tom and i 've decided to go to australia together .
i can 't stop thinking about what we did .
you know that that 's not right .
if she expects them to give her five days off work with pay , she 's going to be disappointed .
my brother uses that bike .
sorry for your loss .
don 't you think that we have a chance to win ?
i 'd like to buy something in a size three .
mary does look really happy , doesn 't she ?
tom was done doing that before anybody got here .
tom told me that he thought that mary was impressed .
i hate when you do that .
it 's a crying shame that they weren 't <unk> against fire .
i 'm in trouble because of you .
tom has lost almost 30 pounds .
i hear the phone .
tom and mary say they haven 't done that in months .
tom is here to help us .
they looked very busy .
you 've invited your friends as well ?
maybe mary would like you to do that for her .
join us outside .
i have three weeks left until my <unk> , and so far i still don 't have a <unk> .
the house stands by itself .
sami was going to <unk> layla on facebook .
tom drives mary to school .
ask mary what she wants to do .
i 'm going to lose .
good actions are never in vain .
the way you 're doing that is dangerous .
each man stood up in turn and introduced himself .
we talk about it all the time .
we 're going to be in boston for three days .
don 't <unk> up . my ass is on the line .
you asked mary if she had to do that , didn 't you ?
i know that tom and mary are usually reasonable .
do you think i could take tom ?
i 'll tell him so when he comes here .
mary will likely change her mind .
it seems that he took me for my sister .
my wife is going out of town for a few days .
tom isn 't my brother . he 's my cousin .
tom can 't sing while he 's eating .
here 's a <unk> of the material i want .
tom and mary went in by themselves .
i think tom loves me .
tom seems a little uncomfortable .
i 've brought you here to meet tom .
i heard you 're having problems with tom .
sami went to visit his father on father 's day .
tom is not to be trusted .
tom should tell mary what he wants to buy .
they said they didn 't have a dog .
this song is not loved by girls .
i had one beer !
i just wanted to protect you .
i need a bag . will you lend me one ?
you can 't even help yourself .
i want that style .
pick up a bag of oranges at the supermarket .
i think that tom will be able to help us next week .
it seemed that he had been ill .
i knew tom would like it if we did that .
how many rich people do you know ?
tom 's life was about to change forever .
i knew that tom would be too tired to help .
tom and mary don 't really know how old their dog is .
what happened to her in boston ?
i know tom is odd .
mary said that she 's sure she won 't win .
i doubt if it 'll rain .
what did you have for supper last night ?
i just want to let you know i think that you 're the most beautiful woman that i 've ever seen .
if it rains tomorrow , the <unk> will be canceled .
she said she 'd love to help .
i need to talk to her now .
i found myself bored by the book .
sami needs to get a break .
if you could choose the <unk> for your children , would you ?
tom and mary said they heard someone singing .
i wasn 't too worried about tom .
mary said she would help .
i thought we were on the same side .
tom is in australia visiting his grandmother .
you can 't hurt her .
i don 't like speaking in french and tom doesn 't either .
there was nothing i could do to help tom .
that 's not a good idea .
tom has to do that pretty soon .
we wish you well , tom .
i might not be able to go swimming with you today .
she told me that she 's thirsty .
i 'm an old friend of the family .
i saw you leave early .
mary drove the boys to the pool .
tom decided that he wouldn 't tell mary anything about the incident .
i asked you not to smoke in the office .
your bath is ready .
the doctor advised mr. white not to smoke a lot .
i think tom and mary are joking .
i gave it my all .
he likes neither baseball nor football .
goal !
i 'm taking tom to his favorite restaurant .
sami wanted to surprise layla .
you don 't know my name , do you ?
i didn 't think tom would like it very much if i used his electric beard <unk> without his permission .
the traffic accident <unk> the young man of his sight .
who bought this food ?
i asked tom about that .
i met an old man who says that he 's never eaten at a restaurant in his whole life .
i was hungry , so i ate .
she knew better than to smoke a cigarette in his presence .
tom didn 't have mary 's address with him .
if i 'm not home when you get there , just wait on the porch .
her death is a blow to my feelings .
i let her win .
why did you open that door ?
there 's been a an increase in <unk> prices .
she is from france .
the party <unk> power entirely for its own sake . we are not interested in the good of others ; we are interested <unk> in power .
you 'll die in jail .
you 're getting better .
we 've forgiven you .
tom arrived home after dark .
i was trying to impress him .
you know that i should do that , don 't you ?
that was excellent .
i didn 't think we had enough food .
tom and mary said that they weren 't full .
sami 's kids were safe .
tom would be done doing that by now if he 'd started earlier .
do you have any idea where tom put the keys ?
i appreciate your offer .
sami was shocked when he learned that layla had been having an affair .
i didn 't know you could cook so well .
you are here now in a doctor 's surgery .
i 'll show her the way .
" who did that ? " " i did . "
i worked with tom for three years in boston .
justice must be done .
how long do you think it 'll take us to do this ?
i never said i wasn 't happy .
i 'll do my best to have the report ready by 2 : 30 .
we 're going to go into the other room .
tom isn 't used to this kind of work .
tell tom everything you know .
tom and i pretended we didn 't know each other .
promise me that you won 't do that again .
they promised me they 'd do that for us .
tom hoped that mary wouldn 't win .
tom promised me he 'd do that .
she is not only fluent in english but speaks french fluently as well .
sami comes over to my apartment pretty much every day .
sami grew up in a sleepy <unk> town .
i 've got to stay .
the bomb destroyed three houses .
i think tom should try to get mary to do that .
i hope tom and mary feel the same way you do about this .
when do you have to be in boston ?
i haven 't finished eating yet .
it occurred to me that the man was trying to <unk> me out of my money .
how many <unk> do you want to lose ?
i 'm pretty sure that tom and mary have never been to boston .
tom said that he knew you couldn 't win .
that 's the key .
taking an <unk> a day can be bad for you .
tom admitted that he didn 't really know how to speak french .
mary said she didn 't want to get married .
tom said mary wasn 't prepared .
i 'll let tom know that you want to see him .
tom said that mary didn 't eat <unk> .
" god speed his return . " " so i pray . "
tom isn 't likely to be alone .
tom lied to mary when he said he wouldn 't do that .
i do wish tom would stop calling me that .
i know that tom is a little <unk> .
since you 're going to the room , can you tell <unk> to come over here ?
that 's what we usually do .
i didn 't know i 'd be allowed to do that .
i don 't think tom will get fired , at least not this week .
tom became fluent in french fairly quickly .
tom does almost anything he 's asked to do .
i need you to find him .
i found this in the kitchen .
do you think something will happen soon ?
i know that tom didn 't know i couldn 't do that .
i 've caught a lot of fish here . it 's a great fishing spot .
this is the first time that i have visited <unk> .
tom said that you had some experience with this .
sami and layla were both in shock .
that country 's wealth comes from its oil .
what i mean is this .
i don 't think that i should be here .
he claims that you stole them .
tom can leave if he wants .
what is the time ?
you are at work .
i guess that i won 't be seeing tom anymore .
as far as i know , he is a reliable person .
every person is special .
tom is really slow .
tom turned the page .
what did you do with the money ?
you may say that it 's shit .
i think we should give up .
where do you think i should start ?
it 's difficult to get out of bed on cold <unk> .
he was the first to jump into the world of computers at our company .
because the parents divorced , the girl had little contact with the father .
you 're different with tom .
tom is still a policeman , isn 't he ?
i think that tom was the first one to do that .
the patient 's condition improved .
mary promised she won 't do that .
she started dating boys much older than her .
why do you want to study abroad ?
can you really blame them ?
it isn 't hard to find .
i wish i 'd been at the meeting last monday .
i get the feeling that no one here is telling us the truth .
tom plays tennis every monday .
tom told me he thought that mary would be hesitant to do that .
it 's a big universe .
i 'm sure tom was here yesterday .
it 's in the garage .
that 's what 's great about tom .
sami was expecting company .
make someone happy .
mary wears the same clothes that all her friends are wearing .
i know tom isn 't a very good pilot .
tom had no idea why mary was planning on staying in australia for so long .
tom and mary say they aren 't interested in doing that .
let me try that .
i 've already told tom and mary i won 't help them .
today 's special is fish .
i think tom did that .
some tourists have bad manners .
will they <unk> him for four more years ?
i pushed tom into the water .
open the door . they are <unk> the bell .
my hands are cold .
see if you can find out more about tom .
she was boring .
we looked up .
my car ran out of gas .
will i have time to do that today ?
tom said he wasn 't planning to do that .
imagine for a second what he had to go through to be there today .
the water ran down the rain pipe .
layla stayed away .
" <unk> , it sure is " " enough . " " i just " " enough ! " " how a " " enough ! " " but father " " die . "
she set off on a trip last week .
i should have studied harder before the term <unk> .
i don 't think that we 're right for each other anymore .
tom said mary has done that .
tom said that mary thought the judge 's decision was fair .
that 's why i need a lawyer .
i woke up at ten o 'clock .
i know that i locked the door .
did you ask mary why she did that ?
do you think tom speaks french better than mary ?
well , now , who would have thought it ?
everybody loved fadil .
is tom one of them ?
a dance will be held on friday .
i 'm not a very good french speaker .
i 'm beautiful in my way because god makes no mistakes .
i gave her one of those .
tom said that he liked my idea .
how are we going to get off this island ?
mary said she was going to die .
i knew you wouldn 't have a good time .
tom asked mary to give him her old <unk> .
i doubt we can prove that .
what kind of beer do you usually drink ?
how many more hours do you think tom will want to do that ?
she said that she 'd help us .
tom and i are going to boston to attend a wedding .
at that time , i didn 't yet know exactly what i should do .
i 'm not allowed to do anything .
you 've never been married , have you ?
her father is japanese .
tom doesn 't want to do anything new .
sorry , i don 't get your point .
mary is good at cooking , isn 't she ?
i can 't believe i just did what i did .
they could get fired if they did that .
he only does what he has to do .
it got quite late , but the little <unk> could not take her eyes off the ship and the beautiful prince .
sami cares a lot .
she bought a present for her son .
show me what you have got in your hand .
tom said that he thinks that he can take care of himself .
what kind of a sick joke is this ?
the bank is not open for business on sundays .
text me the address .
that seems hard to believe .
please don 't leave the windows open .
tom thinks mary would probably not do that .
i couldn 't have done it better myself .
sami kept changing his story .
i need you right now .
tom asked mary to help him <unk> the party .
the professor is on the phone .
there isn 't a <unk> in the sky ; it 's not going to rain on us .
mary has decided she 'll do that .
nobody who works forty hours a week should be living in poverty .
talk to him .
tom and mary have apparently been arguing with john .
she is the victim of this incident .
i 'm going to the well to get water .
no one lives here anymore .
i had a bad headache yesterday . that was why i was absent .
from that time <unk> hated me with her whole heart and soul .
i told tom you were coming .
i should have known better than to call him .
he hit me back .
we both can sleep in the same tent .
mary gave tom the first piece of cake .
it is too late to watch a film .
roses are my favorite flowers .
i thought that you knew how to do that .
i doubt that we 'll be able prove that .
sami saw layla .
i 'm dying to meet you .
don 't smell it . it might be <unk> .
tom cut mary 's hair .
with your looks , you could probably have any man you want .
he does not seem to be very tired .
tom loves playing football .
it is as if the whole sky were on fire .
i 've caused everyone enough trouble already .
i do that as often as i can .
don 't be afraid , tom . there 's no need to worry .
let 's let her decide .
that is not what we are going to talk about .
is it always wrong to take a human life ?
sami was intoxicated .
tom has two sons . both of them live in boston .
i hear that tom and mary really like living in boston .
tom put the key in his pocket .
tom 's hair went flat with the <unk> .
tom told me he felt offended .
i wish tom could have come , too .
tom and mary don 't know why john wants them to go to boston with him .
i was afraid that i might chicken out .
call me when you leave work .
i know that tom won 't allow us to do that .
i can 't put up with all that noise .
i need that information now .
tom came to see me yesterday afternoon .
tom and mary 's love for each other was so strong it was almost <unk> .
tom didn 't know whether he 'd be permitted to do that .
mary is in her bedroom .
since i parked too close to the wall , i had to get out of the car on the <unk> side .
there 's something in this box .
there is no excuse for your actions .
the sun goes down , the stars come out .
tom said that he 'd assumed mary would win .
you shouldn 't rely on other people 's help .
he jumped into water without <unk> his clothes .
i 'm probably doing this wrong .
there 's still plenty of time .
tom lives in a large house by himself .
i am not such a fool but can appreciate it .
there were teachers yelling .
tom seemed to be hurt .
tom is always <unk> , isn 't he ?
we can 't just leave mary here by herself .
tom said he doesn 't think that mary should do that alone .
why would things change now ?
you didn 't know that tom and i were supposed to do that by ourselves , did you ?
he told me that he liked the party .
tom could have told me the truth .
i think tom would be a good neighbor .
tom couldn 't stay awake during class .
this doesn 't count .
i 'm expecting tom .
we have nothing further to say to each other .
tom wouldn 't speak to the media .
that 's probably how layla was killed .
mary told tom that she didn 't think john would be the next one to do that .
mary said she thought tom was going to win .
i saw the girls pick the wild flowers .
we 've got to find a doctor .
mr <unk> is famous all over the world .
whatever he takes up , he gets soon tired of it .
i don 't think i can do that today .
if tom and mary really had wanted to do that , they would 've .
you have to be kidding !
how is it possible that no one saw tom <unk> from the prison cell ?
i just kept winning .
they heard a voice behind them .
is everything ok with her ?
you should 've told me about what tom did .
my brother sometimes helps me with my homework .
i spent the whole week alone , and i <unk> for conversation .
tom doesn 't know how to milk a cow .
i should have been more patient .
do native americans still speak in their languages when they meet in <unk> ?
i saw no other choice .
i was in australia for almost the entire summer .
i liked tom better with longer hair .
thank you very much for your letter .
sami is starting to look very pale .
mary admitted she was heartbroken .
tom is devoted to his three children .
i 've told tom where mary is .
tom didn 't need to do that by himself .
i don 't intend to stay in australia for more than three <unk> .
it was a pretty amazing experience .
i can 't believe tom didn 't come .
tom doesn 't want to wait for you .
i 'm up to the ears in debt .
tom isn 't really planning on doing that , is he ?
what 's wrong with telling tom what happened ?
he lost his balance and fell down .
tom and mary told me that they 'd do it tomorrow .
i was so sure it was tom .
i hope the work is finished .
you can sit next to me .
tom and mary haven 't yet told me who helped them .
you have the right to be creative .
i wonder whether tom thinks mary has to do that .
he has to protect his family .
that flower smells sweet .
use kitchen <unk> to remove the skin from the chicken .
we have to do a better job .
tom said that mary thought john might need to do that this evening .
sami asked me to call him back .
as soon as tom gets here , i 'll tell him .
mary said she didn 't have to do that anymore .
tom will visit australia .
looking outside , i noticed that it was starting to rain .
tom and mary used the money i gave them to buy <unk> .
tom gave me a nice umbrella , but i 've lost it .
my parents call me up every day .
we can 't afford to do that .
put that cigarette out .
she is a quiet woman .
the question was so complicated that they were all <unk> up .
would you like to hang out with us ?
it is the first time i have seen such a <unk> room .
we 're gonna make sure that no one is taking advantage of the american people for their own <unk> gain .
you didn 't think tom would be able to do that , did you ?
sami 's daughter stopped wearing the hijab .
tom doesn 't feel up to going out today .
let 's go and surprise tom .
for her first task at the tv station , mary had to report on a football game .
he has three cars in his garage .
do you think she 's innocent ?
i told tom why i went to australia .
it looks as if tom isn 't going to go to boston with us .
we <unk> with each other in driving the car .
we speak the same language , don 't we ?
you sit here , tom , and you sit over there , mary .
it 's kept secret from tom .
tom isn 't paying us anything .
i 'd like to schedule an appointment with <unk> jackson .
tom found mary 's purse under the sofa .
he 's worried about his grades .
i don 't feel very well .
tom has developed feelings for mary .
i know you want to be happy .
we have to do the best that we can .
one does not wear a red <unk> skirt to a funeral .
tom and mary need somebody they could trust .
sami finally took the stand .
we aren 't all like that .
i told you the concert was going to be boring . why didn 't you believe me ?
please excuse me for a minute .
don 't make noise when you eat soup .
tom can 't go on .
he is an honor to his family .
read as many newspapers as you can so as to keep up with the times .
any problem that can be <unk> with money isn 't a problem , but the problem is that i 'm poor .
was tom on your team ?
i have more money than him .
are you sure tom and mary were the ones who did this ?
he always makes sure to come on time .
that 's suicide .
i knew tom wouldn 't be able to guess the answer .
tom has done some awful things .
watch out for him . that guy can really hold a <unk> .
if i had seen tom yesterday , i would have talked to him .
when do you take down your christmas tree ?
we are looking for the boy and the dog that are lost .
i want to stay here a few days .
tom is quite a catch .
i think tom is a lot better chess player than mary .
soccer is the world 's most popular sport .
i don 't think it 's weird at all .
you have long hair .
he wanted to fight with the teacher .
i 've been preparing for this my entire life .
nobody in my family is a musician .
i had too many <unk> , so i fell behind soon enough .
tom said that he was really jealous .
sami and layla used the <unk> to make out .
tom and mary told me that they knew how i felt .
though i was tired , i did my best .
make sure that you pick me up at five , please .
tom has been wasting a lot of time .
you don 't want tom to think you 're poor .
i cannot approve of your going out with him .
i 've met so many new people .
tom drew a <unk> and shot john 's hat off his head .
this is the address .
tom was <unk> , but mary wasn 't .
where did you put it ?
mother always tells me not to sit up late at night .
i don 't think anybody really thought tom was busy .
tom is bound to lose the race .
you 're about right .
tom let me know that he didn 't like to do that .
he walked with someone .
i doubt tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done .
your voice sounds very familiar to me .
i don 't think tom and mary were fair .
tom didn 't seem to like you a lot .
all my friends <unk> me to try my best .
i think tom won 't be the first one to do that .
since you have a cold , you must not go out .
i don 't think tom knows exactly what he should be doing .
she told me she won 't marry me .
it 's unlikely that tom will go to boston with us .
the reason i did that was because tom asked me to .
how much are they willing to pay ?
tom and mary wanted to say more than they did .
i felt that that somewhere in this world a mission which i knew nothing about yet was waiting for me .
what do you say to eating out tonight ?
tom said you might be able to help .
tom and mary didn 't deny they did that .
tom and mary said that they should go .
mary says her left leg hurts .
you can 't blame him for being curious .
have you paid your phone bill yet ?
we 're doing it for free .
i wish i had something to give tom .
i 'd think twice about that , if i were you .
i regret that i can 't understand what you have said in english .
tom has been in australia before .
we had a good time in boston .
no matter how hard he may work , he will not be able to pass the <unk> .
tom said he thought mary was having a good time in boston .
i ate absolutely nothing the whole day .
i warned you once .
i told tom he should ask mary out .
he didn 't tell me his name .
has anybody heard from him ?
it 'll take a little time to get used to wearing glasses .
i don 't think tom and mary are going to like that .
i thought tom would be busy .
i never noticed that .
he told me that he wanted to help .
you must stand up for what you believe in or no one will respect you .
the movie is drawing pretty well .
she said she liked rain .
you should not play on his generous nature .
i know that tom did that last week .
it comes from within the love that i feel for you .
i believe doing that would be a mistake .
i 'm starting to feel hungry .
i don 't often drink beer at home .
the door 's locked .
tom gets my vote .
tom told us he thought he could become a famous singer .
i 've learned a great deal about tom .
do you want me to take care of that matter ?
how dare you do that to a girl , tom ?
the earth doesn 't belong to man ; man belongs to the earth .
i was a bad student .
tom and mary said that they 're supportive .
i haven 't read today 's newspaper yet .
the <unk> in the hotel lobby knows a lot about the local traffic conditions .
tom will be here to do that .
what else does tom have to do ?
it took tom a long time to get over mary .
i bet tom doesn 't have any plans .
if you want to know god , read this book .
that 's why i need to go back to australia .
they 're not sure they can do that .
it 's been a pleasure doing business with you .
this isn 't about me .
nobody but tom knows what to do .
we can 't leave you alone .
he said , i am not .
when did you return from australia ?
tom thought that mary might have to walk home by herself .
tom and i talked about how we were going to spend the money .
you don 't do that the same way i do .
tom says that mary thinks she can win .
<unk> told me which book i should buy .
sami had lost his wife six years <unk> .
tom didn 't visit anybody .
tom said he 'd be happy to answer our questions .
why were you with them ?
i confessed .
tom and mary seemed to be <unk> enjoying themselves .
sami is going home .
he never had chicken <unk> as a child .
where do you think any problems might <unk> ?
i told you it was going to be fine .
we 'll see each other on sunday .
so . having had all that done to him it would be stranger if he wasn 't <unk> .
uncle <unk> gave me a painting as a gift .
my wife wants to learn berber .
we forgot to bring one plate .
tom brought way too much food , so there was some left over .
layla can 't have children .
tom told me that he used to be rich .

i suspect that tom and mary are awake .
i still have a piece of <unk> in my chest .
i thought tom might enjoy that movie .
tom thinks that mary will probably not want to do that .
mary hasn 't <unk> her legs in three years .
i was given the task of cleaning the office .
" there must be a <unk> explanation for it . " " not everything can be explained through <unk> , my dear tom . "
tom told me he doesn 't think mary will agree to do that .
we have so much in common .
you 'll be through doing that by monday , won 't you ?
i 've got you down for six o 'clock .
tom and mary are ready to do that .
tom refused mary 's offer to help .
this museum is one of the world 's largest art <unk> .
i 'm not ever going to be able to do that .
" what ! you 're still with that girl ? " and we answer : " what can i do ! i love her ! "
it isn 't at all <unk> . in fact , it 's very common .
none of this would 've been necessary if we 'd followed tom 's advice .
tom has my vote .
to scare us , tom tells ghost stories with a terrible voice .
i have a few friends in the united states .
tom is one of the thirty people who were <unk> .
sami and layla are getting married saturday .
she 'll get herself killed .
they look like they 're troubled .
i want the freedom to my country , so that other countries can learn something from my free country .
she couldn 't help feeling sorry for him .
then is it war again , after so long a <unk> ?
you should thank me .
the number is engaged .
he lives in a flat .
you 're clever .
i still think about him .
tom and mary regretted what they did .
tom 's friends knew that tom was having money problems .
we may never have another chance to talk in private .
sami asked layla to stay away from him .
she blamed everybody except herself .
we put up at a small hotel on the edge of the town .
how could i say no ?
she 's feeling much better thanks to that medical treatment .
tom said he wanted mary to be happy .
mary forced herself to do that .
she will <unk> the secret out of him . i had better trust her with it at once .
thanks for spending so much time helping us .

tom and mary almost never argue .
dan couldn 't understand the <unk> of what had taken place .
i told her i was there .
let 's allow tom to do that again .
were tom and mary involved in what happened today ?
tom didn 't seem to be as lazy as mary seemed to be .
i 'm a member of the sales department .
that something is difficult must be a reason more to do it .
i think you should help him .
she said that she 's done .
i had seen my husband for the first time , on that day .
tom said he hoped that mary would eat what he made .
we have a long and cold winter , but we know how to enjoy it .
i was beaten by tom .
sami played a lot of games .
i was a guest at tom 's house for a week .
i 'm always ready to do that .
i know tom has done that at least three times .
have you lied to me ?
we need to be very careful not to break anything .
mary told me she likes living in boston .
sami broke into layla 's home .
that would 've been very nice .
i asked tom if i could talk to him in private .
the small town woke up to the news that fadil was missing .
you don 't need my permission to do that .
i think i 'll be ok in a minute .
i lost my train of thought .
tom and mary gave me their keys .
i didn 't know tom was a criminal when i first met him .
i was hoping tom wouldn 't be here .
we are going to talk in a little while .
they say that they 'll never do it again .
you won 't believe the view from here .
the two of them have been in australia for over three years .
i play football now . and you ? what are you doing ?
i know that tom wants to do that here .
tom and mary said they thought john wasn 't good at french .
i don 't care what you were .
they say that they aren 't planning on going .

i hope i can pass the exam .
i think it 's time for me to close the window .
i don 't have the <unk> to do that .
in the light of what you told us , i think we should <unk> our plan .
all at once they began to laugh .
mary said she wouldn 't do that anymore .
i always felt like she was hiding something .
i told you not to come today .
why would you tell tom that ?
to hell with your problems .
tom threatened to kill himself .
tom told me he thought that mary was serious .
please don 't ask tom .
please bring my book up when you come .
mary is going to hurt herself .
he succeeded in business .

layla and sami ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time .
i really think my gym teacher hated me .
how old is that dog ?
i knew you 'd kiss tom .
i don 't remember what i did yesterday .
perhaps tom and mary don 't use it anymore .

we had no money .
i know that tom would be surprised if mary did that .
don 't come back until you 've done what i 've asked you to do .
tom says he 's ready to get back to work .
he did that as often as he could .
they admitted they were skeptical .
we are <unk> to get a storm before the day is out .

tom said that he thought that he 'd find another job .
i 've seen things .
tom , there 's something you need to know .
you weren 't fair .
everyone was totally shocked .
i wonder if tom likes doing that .
sami was also very tall .
i wouldn 't have done that the way tom did it .
i just picked them up .
my father likes fishing , and so do i .
sami had to put the <unk> back together before his boss came back .

i don 't think that i was followed .
i know tom knows something .
i 've got just about everything i need .
you said tom loved his son .
all the students are studying english .

tom isn 't such a bad sort .
the sky was bright and clear .
this is the desk which ken uses .
sami made sure everything was set up right .
tom said no such thing .
mary says she 'll go with us .
there 's no point arguing about what 's true and what 's false .
he said he was canadian .
i 'm proud of my dad .
i was just making a suggestion .
when did tom and mary buy their car ?
i guess that 's about it .
the divorce was going to be so <unk> for sami .
tom thought that he heard his name being called .
you must 've seen tom .
you 'll need a special <unk> to do it .
she is very fast .
it isn 't going to be that hard .
mary never read the book that tom gave her .
i 'm satisfied with his progress .
we 'll begin tomorrow morning .
she knows that it 's her call .
can you please go away ?
i really must be going .
i can 't afford this .
he has a great knowledge of the <unk> field .
i 've got tired of your lies .
tom and mary wished they hadn 't asked john to stop doing that .
the dog ran after the cat .
i 'm doing my french homework .
i think tom and mary have to be told not to do that .
i would do it in a different way than you did .
tom won 't be getting any money from me .
tom didn 't give me what i needed .
why are you doing this to me now ?
i 'm changing my clothes .
tom and mary don 't think they 're permitted to do that .
mary shouted as loud as she could , but tom didn 't hear her .
the kitchen is on the ground floor .
tom and i wanted to go to the dance together .
what you want isn 't possible .
tom said that he didn 't know how mary did that .
tom isn 't the one who convinced mary to teach john how to drive .
i will be here two hours later than <unk> said .
how much time and money would we save ?
man , that 's hard !
i thought that you 'd want to go to the concert with us .
it was pretty obvious tom was the one who did that .
she said she didn 't want me to worry .

the <unk> were from <unk> france and spoke french . during the <unk> <unk> , french became the language of england s <unk> and wealthy class . this lasted for more than 300 years . other people in england continued to speak english during this period .

love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own .
mary probably did that by herself .
there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can 't .
tom and mary said they wished they hadn 't permitted john to do that .
thanks for coming , guys ! see you around !
i thought tom and mary were right .

i told tom and mary it would be dangerous to do that , but they still wanted to do it .
i know that tom would tell mary how to do that if she asked him to .
if you can 't do that , we 'll need to find somebody who can .
tom realized later that he shouldn 't have done that .
i have absolutely nothing to do today .
i 'm not a singer .
it 's out of your hands .
i don 't think anybody has ever done this before .

you won 't be allowed another mistake .
it 's a present for tom , isn 't it ?
i guess that 's impossible .

i think i shouldn 't have told tom where i live .
we expect you and your workers to fully <unk> in the investigation .

tom is younger than most of us here .
the pool is closed because they are changing the broken <unk> .
i don 't feel like going in <unk> this year .

could we have a minute of silence ?
i consider her an honest woman .
tom said that he wanted to go home early today .

i heard that tom is in the hospital .
the <unk> house was destroyed , but mine survived just a bit of cost for repair .
they slept in <unk> rooms until they were married .
does it make a difference ?

there 's not much to tell .
i wouldn 't do that to anybody .

can you spare me a couple of minutes ?

he has experience in business .
" what time is it now ? " " it 's ten o 'clock . "
i shouldn 't have .
let 's see if tom and mary have any questions .
the reason that tom went to boston was to do that .
sami didn 't really have to work .
he wanted to be elected again .
i was afraid you wouldn 't understand .
clever ideas often <unk> me , but i 'm faster !
doing that would be extremely dangerous .
let tom finish what he 's saying .
tom is in the backyard , playing with his friends .
is she going to make it ?
i don 't think tom would be happy doing that .
why don 't you ask tom to do it ?
you 've told me this story before .
sami is weird and i don 't like him .
i can 't take this pain any more .
i 'd like a word with tom in private .
someone 's behind me .
sami worked for a pretty big company .
sami left food and water for his dog .
she was surprised that it was that late .
did you have a fun time last night ?

tom wasn 't the one who suggested that we raise prices .
i hope tom is more careful next time .
tom said that mary seemed drunk .
do you enjoy plays , <unk> , and such ?
you look upon my idea as being behind the times .
you needed space , didn 't you ?
that isn 't what tom really needs to do .
i told her it was urgent .
i suspect that tom and mary are the ones who stole the money .
though the <unk> have seven children , they seem to make ends meet .
tom said he could 've done that on his own .
how did you find out that tom was the one who did that ?
don 't forget to tell mary that she needs to do that this week .
tom should have told me he was married .
i was <unk> you could have stayed a little girl , even with all your <unk> ways .
i am sorry . it was stupid of me .
that 's water under the bridge .
we didn 't need to ask him to resign .
i don 't know whether i can translate this book or not .
tom probably won 't be able to find what he 's looking for .
we are not sure , but she is right .
have you ever thought about that ?
i told you to lock the door .
i used to be a pretty good dancer .
tom would want me to say that .
i suspect that tom and mary are eager to do that .
if you like honey , don 't be afraid of <unk> .
shall we go out for a walk ?
tom needs to do that sometime this week .
i write with my left hand .
let 's get one thing straight . you and i are not friends . we 're <unk> against a common enemy .
tom told me that he thought mary was clever .
i 've been sick since last monday .
you should 've seen the look on tom 's face when i told him about what mary did .
mary said more than she 'd planned to .
the question is who is going to tell him .
i know tom could do that by himself if he tried .
i was surprised about it .
i 'll help you find him .
i have a new <unk> and i 've named him dan .
tom almost forgot to tell mary what she had to do .
maybe we can do that .

the point of play is that it has no point .
his story may be true .
mary put on her clothes .
i chose to resign .
i don 't think you need to tell tom what mary said that she 's going to do .
she said that she liked skiing .
sami had to go through hard time .
are you still planning to come to the party ?
i kicked tom .
i gave her everything .
i hope that he will succeed .
you should do that before tom and mary get here .
he knew what he ought to do .
you don 't seem to be very concerned .
we made a huge mistake .
i have just finished eating .
the year stole by .
you used to love boston .
sami doesn 't date layla anymore .
why do you want that anyway ?
tom didn 't know you weren 't planning on doing that .

tom wouldn 't likely be able to talk mary into doing that .
bill is honest all the time .

tom started <unk> at the age of thirteen .
why are you still upset ?
i figured tom and mary weren 't old enough .

that 's what i should 've said .
there , there . it 's all better now .
what tom really wanted was some time with his children .
that guard <unk> to do everything by the book .
i had to let her go .
they lived on their own for years .
we have an important matter to discuss .
sami wanted something in return .
tom thought that i might be allowed to do that .
we discussed the matter .
let 's give this a shot .

she died when she was very young .
can you get tom ?
last week , i didn 't do that as much as i usually do .

i myself am very frustrated .
let 's see what 's wrong with it .
tom is to blame as well .
tom is the <unk> person working in our company .
that 's what tom and mary did .
oh ! show it to me please .
we 're worried about you .
i don 't think tom knows whether mary can do that or not .

tom and mary told me they were <unk> .
i hope tom had a good time .
they said they felt good .
you must take care of me .
tom has been in bed all day .
tom and mary said that they saw something scary .
she asked me to leave the room .
i know that tom shouldn 't do that .
if it is fine tomorrow , i will go <unk> with my friends .
in their eyes , he can do no wrong .
that wasn 't the plan .
he should blame himself .
i don 't want children .
i wonder if tom would mind helping us tomorrow .
okay , thanks , i understand now .
i asked him to play the guitar .
today isn 't so hot .
do you remember the first time that you and i went out together ?
that 's one of my new year 's <unk> .
i don 't yet know whether tom can go or not .
i knew that that was going to happen .
i quit my job the day before yesterday .
you sounded mad .
tom said that he doesn 't like to do that .
when i first met sami , he was a <unk> teenager .
i wouldn 't bother to fix that if i were you .
sami watched that happen .
sami should know layla .
tom and mary say that they 've never eaten <unk> food .
i think i 'm a pretty normal girl .

i learned to play the guitar when i was ten .
tom will be ready in just a minute .
tom has an <unk> sense for modern painting .
tom is tempted .
what time do tom and mary eat breakfast ?
a solution must be found .
i think that what you need now is some sleep .
i was surprised to see you here .
they 're all terrified .
we couldn 't find tom .
what time is it currently in paris ?
maybe tom and mary are guilty .
maybe that wouldn 't be appropriate . you see , i don 't work here .
sami won 't survive this .
we need get to the <unk> of the problem .
i don 't have to go to the dentist 's .
i wonder whether tom thinks i have to do that or not .
when you don 't know what to do , ask the <unk> .
do you have anything to say to us ?
tom murdered mary .
the dog eats the fish , the <unk> , the tail , and all .
let no one escape .
just between you and me , do you love my sister ?
she 's sleeping in her car .
don 't call me sir .
tom ate half of my sandwich .
i was in boston when tom was arrested .

i wasn 't surprised tom didn 't have to do that .
sami wanted layla to get better .
she has got it .
what do you think tom and mary will do now that they 're retired ?
tom is going to try to find out why mary wants to do that .
has anyone spoken to her ?
i cry almost every day .
let 's take a taxi .
there were many things that bothered me about that contract .
do you know why mary killed herself ?
he wanted to protect his family .
turn off the light and go to sleep .
tom said that his job was a lot of fun .
i know how it is .
tom said that mary was mean .
i thought you said that you were an only child .
they said they wanted me to stop .
he told me he loved me .
there was nothing for it but to <unk> it .
he doesn 't <unk> either of his parents .
tom isn 't the only person who didn 't want to do that .
i didn 't know if tom and mary would be able to do that by themselves or not .
tom couldn 't get the engine started .
this book is really difficult to finish reading in a week .
she asked me to lend her some money .
sami went to egypt to live with layla .
i told you never to do that again .
i don 't drink , but i 'm drunk because of you .
tom was sitting between his parents .
he is more human in thinking than his father .
tom isn 't helping mary do that .
tom works at a nearby hospital .
the girls are shy .
did you tell tom that we 're going to australia ?
tom offered to lend me money .
it certainly has been fun .

i 'll protect you !
he said that he was really sick .
thanks for the flowers .
mary explained her plan in detail .
sami and layla were hanging out in his room .
mary had surgery on her right leg .
it was really annoying .
ask whatever you want to .
sami was doing something in the bathroom .
i own this street corner .
tell me what you have in your hand .
mary isn 't as interested in doing that as she used to be .
i haven 't been to boston , but tom has .

i wonder whether or not tom wants to go to boston with us .
do you wish you 'd done that sooner ?

more than 300 people attended .
tom told everybody that he was ticklish .
where will it end ?
i just love you so much .
thank you for doing that for me .
i found out the truth .
the teacher always thinks highly of the students who try to think , " why ? " .
we have to consider the possibility that tom may have to do that .
you look happier than usual .
i tried to convince him .
what 's to stop tom from doing that again ?
your house is cool .
you 've only been here three days .
for many are called , but few are chosen .
mary used to make fun of tom , but she doesn 't anymore .
you 'd better not have gone out with my girlfriend .
we were happy .
they lost their way in the mountain .
tom usually doesn 't have to work on monday <unk> .
tom didn 't move his lips .
do you have any advice for me ?
i won 't have to go there by myself .
tom didn 't care what mary did .
i suspect that tom and mary are sleepy .
there 's no one in the house .
" whose umbrella is this ? " " i don 't know , but i maybe it 's tom 's . "
i don 't think that it 'll be difficult to for me do that .
i think tom hasn 't done that since october .
isn 't something burning in the kitchen ?
i wish i were better at swimming .
tom doesn 't know i 'm hungry .
you 're not a very good <unk> , are you ?
i no longer need a loan .
the new medicine saved his life .
i want to sleep a little more .
mary lives in a big house all by herself .
why didn 't you bring an umbrella ?
he 's giving himself up to drink .
tom should 've never tried to leave early .
it 's a village in the middle of nowhere .
if i can do that , so can you .
our team is one player short .
where did you say that happened ?
she isn 't happy , is she ?
i don 't think that tom knows what he 's talking about .
here 's my address .
i know that tom knew you should 've done that by yourself .
i will honor christmas in my heart , and try to keep it all the year .
mary is headed this way , isn 't she ?
tom must have forgotten to do that .
could i get you to help me for a second ?
the moment he saw me , he grew pale and ran away .
be sure to look over your paper again before you hand it in .
i hope tom won 't tell me to do that .
her dress was cheap .
a face without <unk> is like a sky without stars .
he may not be able to come .
they had no place to go .
how impatient are you ?
i did it and i would do it again .
i 'm not in a mood to go out .
i wonder whether tom knew we should do that or not .
sami will have to be more careful .
tom must 've missed the train .
tom doesn 't fit in here .
sami had girls everywhere .
i 'd like to meet her .
it isn 't a dream .
i know that tom will allow mary to do that by herself .
tom wanted to see mary again .
i threw the shoes out the window .
what choice do we have ?
aren 't you a student here ?
he rejected our offer .
let 's keep this simple .
that 's already been done .
tom admitted that he did what mary said he shouldn 't do .
sami surely didn 't know about it .
i don 't know who to turn to .
you must do it for yourself .
if you need anything , ring my bell any time . i 'll be glad to help you .
tom painted his bicycle red .
i don 't think tom was satisfied .
this boy has been up all night .
he can run so fast !
tell me the rest .
we made a date to meet soon .
if i knew it was going to upset you so much , i wouldn 't have mentioned it .
she needs them .
how good was tom today ?
do you like your new apartment ?
i don 't feel like eating right now .
japan is to the east of china .
i also have a motorcycle .
how much knowledge do i need to run a business ?
i 've never tried doing that .
tom kissed mary .
i think i 'm going to like living here .
life in the country isn 't always <unk> .
i don 't think that it 's very likely that tom will tell us what to do .
there are two <unk> in the backyard and two in the front yard .
i didn 't attack anyone .
you are stupid .
the only thing tom ate was one <unk> of bread .
these are <unk> of an ancient missing culture .
tom is waiting for his friend .
i 'm quite certain tom didn 't win .
tom pointed at the open window .
this sentence needs to be checked .
can you show me where you live on this map ?
i thought that you knew something that i didn 't know .
mary tried to hold back her tears .
they let me know that they needed do that .
tom climbed over the wall .
there are many old men in this village .
tom said that many people have been complaining .
we still have a little money left .
i thought mary might need to do that by herself .
how long is the ride ?
nothing bad happened to tom .
very few people live to be 100 .
mary climbed onto a chair and began to dance .
what does the man look like ?
the problem is whether the plan will work .
have you experienced this ?
she was surprised when she saw the ghost .
i owe him $ 100 .
i had some things to do before the meeting .
you really are fond of eating .
i think that <unk> a work of this kind in this particular way will cause more harm than <unk> !
i think that tom knows french .
sami kind of felt bad for layla .
they are not my friends .
sami can 't go any further .
i told mary not to let go of the rope , but she did .
he isn 't able to swim , is he ?
i 'm excited about going back to australia .
tom and mary couldn 't believe their good luck .
i told you this day would come .
we 're going to try again .
it 's just not possible for me to do this by myself .
tom is in his tent , isn 't he ?
this week has been very busy for both of us .
i 've become close friends with tom .
i needed to see you in person .
i had my reasons for staying in boston .
sami could feel that something else was in the room .
why are you so determined to do that ?
tom doesn 't have very much experience doing that .
she said she wasn 't sleepy .
we took a short rest on the way .
tom and mary sang while they worked .
he can speak both english and french .
it looks like tom is ok .
tom has already seen it .
i don 't have time to clean this house .
sami is so embarrassed .
i now know why i should have left earlier .
will you shut your mouth or not ?
they 're interesting .
tom doesn 't like you that much either .
i 'm about to lose my mind .
tom and mary aren 't going to let you die .
tom isn 't so easy to get along with .
to the world has come a new idea .
we don 't even know what we 're fighting for .
i know tom is a lot taller than i me .
we need help immediately .
tom thinks mary shouldn 't do that .

they say they 'll be careful .
tom and mary said they hoped that john would be here today .
tom gets home at about 2 : 30 every day except monday .
tom said he was going to take a bath .
tom promised himself he wouldn 't do that again .
i didn 't think it would be so easy to do that .
i suspect tom and mary have finished doing that .
i didn 't even get one letter from tom .
fadil had a black eye .
this means war !
they told everyone that they were ticklish .
hold on ! i am coming right now !
this is definitely , ' the good you do for others is good you do yourself ' ! it 's a <unk> because i was helpful !
do you think tom will permit mary to do that ?
let me have your suggestion as to what i am to say .
mary could 've been finished doing that by 2 : 30 if she 'd worked a little faster .
i think that tom was supposed to be here by now .
she said she has nothing to hide .
we missed out on a lot .
i don 't think tom knows he has to do that today .
tom is a big liar .

tom still has many friends in australia .
i used to come here .
<unk> was waiting for us at the door .

ever since i learned about the existence of the university , i wanted to attend it .
mary lied about who she 'd been with .
he 's in his office , isn 't he ?

tom said that mary didn 't look like a teacher .
she 'll have to do that on her own .
tom wished mary would come back .
i have the impression that tom is doing well .

i found a rare <unk> at that store .
i 'm a child in a man 's body .
what does it smell like ?
did tom tell you to say that ?
is this intended for me ?
can you slow down a minute ?
